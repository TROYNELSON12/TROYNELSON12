Hi I'm Troy, I'm a hobby developer that primarilly works in C# but has a bit of experiance in Java. I first started learning and working with programming in 2016, in 2018 I joined a high school robotics team and began working on a program for scouting alliance members in the FIRST Robotics community, That program is called [RoboScout](https://github.com/AlphaWare-Studios/RoboScout) and is free and open source.
